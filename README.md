# odin-recipes
The Odin Project, first project using HTML. In 4 iterations I will create a recipe book.

/Initial Structure
/Recipe Page
/Recipe Page Content

Style will be added later, I am laying the backbones for now.
This project will also help me learn about creating repositories with Git and how to commit.
